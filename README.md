# DungeonOfHero
A text-based procedurally generated dungeon crawler, with scalable options such as size and other generation settings. The Hero must escape the dungeon by finding the ladder! Use the keyboard to move the Hero towards the exit, but beware, enemy Monsters' movement is determined by an algorithm designed to catch the Hero! Enjoy the game!
